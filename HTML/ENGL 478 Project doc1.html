         <br></br>
         
         
         Dear Sir,
         </p>
      
      
      <p>Since your departure some of my Chicago friends have presented me with certificates
         of character, they having known me many years. They said that they would do no hurt
         to have them with me. </p>
      
      <p>I have also written to Samuel Deanin Salt Lake, for like certificate. I having employed with him in the Quartermaster Department
         as clerk, at the place. I also wrote to Webb &amp; Brother, freighters in that place. They employed me when I first went into the country for
         several months, and knew my reputation while there.</p>
      
      <p> I directed them to send the certificate to you at Ft. Bridger, thinking you would be likely to get them there, as I may be taken west soon to recieve them here.</p>
      
      <p>Mr. Yates came to day and took me out to visit my wife and som other friends. I think him very
         kind, and a perfect gentleman.</p>
      
      <p>Stickneytold some of the prisoners that he had money enough to get him out of this scrape.
         Thouugh I do not fewar that he will accomplish what he effects to.</p>
      
      <p>I have all the faith that any one possible could have in yourself and Mr. Yates, and thinkg that I shall have justice done, and come home exhonorated [exonerated]
         from all blame, for God knows that the thought of committing a wicked crime was never
         in my heart. Words would not induce me to do anything that would brake [break]
         a wife's heart and bring any aged mother in sorrow to her grave. Pray excuse me for
         writing such sentiments but I cannot help it.</p>
      
      <p>Allow me to thank youu for the kind interest you have manifested, for which I shall
         be indebted to you.</p>
      
      <p>Any word from you will gladly be recieved through Mr. Yates at this place.</p>
      
      With Respect<br></br>
      Your obedient servant

         19th 1866 while all three men were traveling together near Salt Lake City. Black at
         the time of writing this letter had been detained in the Cook County Jail in Chicago,
         but would later be released in March of 1867 even though he pleaded guilty, citing
         self defense. </p>
