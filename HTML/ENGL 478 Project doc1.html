         Feby [February]
          19th, 1867
         Judge <sup><a href="#WCarter" id="fn1">1</a></sup>W.A. Carter Esq Washington D.C.
         <br></br>
         
         
         Dear Sir,
         </p>
      
      
      <p>Since your departure some of my Chicago friends have presented me with certificates
         of character, they having known me many years. They said that they would do no hurt
         to have them with me. </p>
      
      <p>I have also written to Samuel Deanin Salt Lake, for like certificate. I having employed with him in the Quartermaster Department
         as clerk, at the place. I also wrote to Webb &amp; Brother, freighters in that place. They employed me when I first went into the country for
         several months, and knew my reputation while there.</p>
      
      <p> I directed them to send the certificate to you at Ft. Bridger, thinking you would be likely to get them there, as I may be taken west soon to recieve them here.</p>
      
      <p>Mr. Yates came to day and took me out to visit my wife and some other friends. I think him very
         kind, and a perfect gentleman.</p>
      
      <p><sup><a href="MStickney" id="fn2">2</a></sup>Stickney told some of the prisoners that he had money enough to get him out of this scrape.
         Though I do not fewar that he will accomplish what he effects to.</p>
      
      <p>I have all the faith that any one possible could have in yourself and Mr. Yates, and thinkg that I shall have justice done, and come home exhonorated [exonerated]
         from all blame, for God knows that the thought of committing a wicked crime was never
         in my heart. Words would not induce me to do anything that would brake [break]
         a wife's heart and bring any aged mother in sorrow to her grave. Pray excuse me for
         writing such sentiments but I cannot help it.</p>
      
      <p>Allow me to thank you for the kind interest you have manifested, for which I shall
         be indebted to you.</p>
      
      <p>Any word from you will gladly be recieved through Mr. Yates at this place.</p>
      
<p color="black"> With Respect</p><br></br>
<p color="black">Your obedient servant,</p>

      <p class="editorial">George W. Black and M.S. Stickney were accused of murdering a Mr. Bicking on October
         19th 1866 while all three men were traveling together near Salt Lake City. Black at
         the time of writing this letter had been detained in the Cook County Jail in Chicago. </p>

      <sup id="WCarter">1. Judge William A. Carter was born in 1818 in Virginia. In 1857 he moved to Fort Bridger primarily to become a trader. In 1867 Judge Carter was contacted by Black, Mrs. Bicking, and Henry Stanbery primarily for his influence as a businessman and Probate Judge in Unita County in Wyoming and was central to the economic activity in Fort Bridger <a href="#fn1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
  <sup id="MStickney">2. M.S. Stickney was a man of wealthy or connected means and travel companion to George W. Black. It is believed Stickney coerced Black to shoot and kill Bicking while the group was all traveling together to Salt Lake City, and he was able to get an early release from the Cook County jail and later sue habeas corpus due to unlawful imprisonment.  <a href="#fn2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
  <sup id="WCarter">3. George W. Black was a trader and frontiersman, likely from a wealthy family. On October 16, 1866 while traveling with Stickney and Bicking near Salt Lake City Black shot and killed Bicking at the prompting of Stickney. The exact reason why is unknown, but Black admitted to commiting the murder even before his arrest in early 1867. Black reached out to Judge Carter in an attempt to secure a character witness, without further elaboration on the details of how they know each other. <a href="#fn3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
