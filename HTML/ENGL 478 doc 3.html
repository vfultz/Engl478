         Much Respected Friend,
         </p>
      
      <p>I would like to write youu a long letter, but it may not be best to do so at present.
         </p>
      
      <p> <sup><a href="#MStickney" id="fn2">2</a></sup>Mr. Sticking has six lawyers employed in his case, and they may give me more toruble
         than anticipated and possibly might hbe the means of having me put to death ignominiously,
         they of course will not five me a fair chance if they can present it. His friends
         have tried to injure me by causing falsehoods to be published in the daily paper.</p>
      
      <p>I have done the same with you that I would have done with my own father were he living,
         and now that justice and right may be sustained and for the sake of my aged mother,
         my wife and myself, I hope that your interest may not grow cold in this case.</p>
      
      <p>The glow that surrounds my friends, caused by the change under which I am held is
         great indeed, and at times causes me to feel desponding.</p>
      
      <p>But I am thankful that in you (through a stranger) I have a friend that will see the
         thing through and show it up in true colors. </p>
      
      <p>I know not how long I may have to stay in Chicago, I would be pleased to have you write to me if consistant [consistent]
         to do.</p>
      
      <p>Hoping that I may see, or hear from you soon, with care,</p>
      
      Your Obt Servant
