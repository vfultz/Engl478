         Chicago Jail March 14, 1867
         
         
         <sup><a href="#WCarter" id="fn1">1</a></sup>Judge W.A. Carter Washington D.C.
         
         
         Much Respected Friend,
         </p>
      
      <p>I would like to write youu a long letter, but it may not be best to do so at present.
         </p>
      
      <p> <sup><a href="#MStickney" id="fn2">2</a></sup>Mr. Sticking has six lawyers employed in his case, and they may give me more toruble
         than anticipated and possibly might be the means of having me put to death ignominiously,
         they of course will not five me a fair chance if they can present it. His friends
         have tried to injure me by causing falsehoods to be published in the daily paper.</p>
      
      <p>I have done the same with you that I would have done with my own father were he living,
         and now that justice and right may be sustained and for the sake of my aged mother,
         my wife and myself, I hope that your interest may not grow cold in this case.</p>
      
      <p>The glow that surrounds my friends, caused by the change under which I am held is
         great indeed, and at times causes me to feel desponding.</p>
      
      <p>But I am thankful that in you (through a stranger) I have a friend that will see the
         thing through and show it up in true colors. </p>
      
      <p>I know not how long I may have to stay in Chicago, I would be pleased to have you write to me if consistant [consistent]
         to do.</p>
      
      <p>Hoping that I may see, or hear from you soon, with care,</p>
      
<p color="black"> Your Obt Servant</p>

<sup id="WCarter">1. Although Black wrote to Carter in order to recieve help on his behalf, newspaper sources and the letter from the State Attorney's Office give the impression that Carter was involved with Black being placed into custody again after his initial release in late February, 1867.<a href="#fn1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
<sup id="MStickney">2. At this point it is presumed that Stickney had been relased and through a network of resources has attempted to place all of the blame on Black as a way to claim innocence.  here<a href="#fn2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
<sup id="GBlack">3. After Black was reincarcerated at the behest of the State Attorney Henry Stanbery he was forced to remain in the Cook County Jail, although no further information about the whether there was a trial or the outcome has been retrieved.  here<a href="#fn3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
