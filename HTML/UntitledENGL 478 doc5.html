      <p> Denver. C. T [Territory] Feb.[February]
         <sup><a href="#WCarter" id="fn1">1</a></sup>Hon.W.A.C </p>
      
      <p>Allow me, even at this late hour, to acknowledge the receipt of your Dispatch, the
         wonderful success with which you met. I learned from the papers. Indeed sir, I felt
         it to be vain mockery to offer thanks for so great a kindness. May the Alwise [All Wise]
          Providence reward you with blessings untold.</p>
      
      <p>Recieved a letter from Mr. Yates on Friday, disiring me to procure the "Requisition Papers", I consulted the "Authorities"
         here and found that nothing could be done here, the dead being perpetrated in "Dacotah".</p>
      
      <p>Fortunately I met a Mr. Wilson, who has been appointed Judge of a County in Dacotah embracing that portion of country where my <sup><a href="#Bicking" id="fn2">2</a></sup>husband was murdered.</p>
      
      <p>He is here awaiting his commission, and will aid in makeing [making]
         out the necessary papers to send to the Govenor who resides at "Yankton".The time required to obtain the returns will be no help than twenty five dayys. In
         the meantime, if there are any suggestions you can make which will be of aid to me,
         or any advice to give, I shall be greatly obliged to you. Would likke to know if <sup><a href="#GBlack" id="fn3">3</a></sup>Blacktold what was done with the body?.</p>
      
      <p>I will not extenuate. Shall be glad to hear from you soon if convenient.</p>
      Respectfully Yours,
      A.E.Bicking

   <sup id="WCarter">1. Judge William A. Carter was born in 1818 in Virginia. In 1857 he moved to Fort Bridger primarily to become a trader. In 1867 Judge Carter was contacted by Black, Mrs. Bicking, and Henry Stanbery primarily for his influence as a businessman and Probate Judge in Unita County in Wyoming and was central to the economic activity in Fort Bridger.<a href="#fn1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
<br/>
   <sup id="Bicking">2. Bicking (first name unknown), the murder victim, was a merchant and peddler who met up with Stickney and Black on their way to Salt Lake City. <a href="#fn2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
<br/>
   <sup id="GBlack">3. George W. Black was a trader and frontiersman, likely from a wealthy family. On October 16, 1866 while traveling with Stickney and Bicking near Salt Lake City Black shot and killed Bicking at the prompting of Stickney. The exact reason why is unknown, but Black admitted to commiting the murder even before his arrest in early 1867. Black reached out to Judge Carter in an attempt to secure a character witness, without further elaboration on the details of how they know each other.<a href="#fn3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
