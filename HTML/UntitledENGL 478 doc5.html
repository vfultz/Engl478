<h2> February 17, 1867 A.E. Bicking to Judge W. A. Carter</h2>
      <p> Denver. C. [T]. Feb. 17th [67]
         Hon.W.A.C </p>
      
      <p>Allow me, even at this late hour, to acknowledge the receipt of your Dispatch, the
         wonderful success with which you met. I learned from the papers. Indeed sir, I felt
         it to be vain mockery to offer thanks for so great a kindness. May the Alwise [All Wise]
          Providence reward you with blessings untold.</p>
      
      <p>Recieved a letter from Mr. Yates on Friday, disiring me to procure the "Requisition Papers", I consulted the "Authorities"
         here and found that nothing could be done here, the dead being perpetrated in <sup><a href="#DT" id="fn1">1</a></sup"Dacotah".</p>
      
      <p>Fortunately I met a Mr. Wilson, who has been appointed Judge of a County in Dacotah embracing that portion of country where my <sup><a href="#Bicking" id="fn2">2</a></sup>husband was murdered.</p>
      
      <p>He is here awaiting his commission, and will aid in makeing [making]
         out the necessary papers to send to the Govenor who resides at "Yankton".The time required to obtain the returns will be no help than twenty five dayys. In
         the meantime, if there are any suggestions you can make which will be of aid to me,
         or any advice to give, I shall be greatly obliged to you. Would likke to know if Black told what was done with the body?.</p>
      
      <p>I will not extenuate. Shall be glad to hear from you soon if convenient.</p>
      <p color="black"> Respectfully Yours,<p>
      A.E.Bicking
