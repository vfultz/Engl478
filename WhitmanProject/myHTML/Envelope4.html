<sup id="NoteaboutNote">1. This note was scrawled sideways on the side of the envelope, presumably by Walt Whitman. It is addressing Jesse O. Norton who studied law in Illinois and was admitted to the bar in 1840. He served as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives in 1851 and 1852. He returned to the practice of law in 1866 and continued until 1869. He received correspondence from the Attorney General Henry Stanbery when he was practicing law. See original photo for more detail.<a href="#fn1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>

<sup id="WCarter">2. Carter was intended to recieve this letter as a copy from the State Attorney Henry Stanebery with the intention of having Carter supply further information or testimony. Curiously, Black was also reaching out to Carter for help.<a href="#fn2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
