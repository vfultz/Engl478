      Jesse O. Norton, Esq. U.S. Attorney.<br></br>
      Chicago. Ill.<br></br>
      Sir:
      
      
      
      <p>I enclose herewith a ltter addressed to me by Mr. W.A. Carter of Utah Terr. in which I am informed that a murder was committed recently in Dakota Terr. of a merchant or peddler named Bicking, whose home was in Denver, Colorado Terr., (where his widow resides still,) by two men named Stickney and Black, (persons formerly belonging in Rochford and Chicago, respectively, in Illinois, where they are said to have opulent &amp; influential relatives.)&#x2014;the latter
         of whom has made full confession;&#x2014;and that both are now in jail at Chicago, Ill., awaiting an examination, which is set for the 8th prose.,; And the proper requisition of the Executive authority of the Territory in which the
         murder was committed, &amp; the proper warrant of extradition for trial in the courts
         of said Territory. The first Sec. of the Act of Congress of 12th Feb. 1793, (12 Stats [States]
         , 302,) seems to afford the Executive authority of the Territory in which the murder
         was committed, all the advice he could need for his action, upon one confirm:ation [confirmation]
          of the fact, But as so early a day has been fixed for the hearing, there is little
         probability that the proper requisition will be forthcoming in so short a time&#x2014; &amp;
         it is possible that
         A failure of justice might result from the absence of parties or counsel interested
         in favor of the prosecution. 
         </p>
      
      <p>Under these peculiar circumstances, you are hereby directed to act for the United States, &amp; the Territory of Dakota, in the matter upon such Data as may be accessible to you, &amp; procure such a commitment
         as shall subverse the ends of justice.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         A copy of this letter is furnished to Mr. Carter, from whom you may expect further
         information &amp; Testimony.
         </p>
      
      Respectfully, &amp; Yours,<br></br>
