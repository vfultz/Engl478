      <sup><a href="#fn1" id="JNorton">1</a></sup>Jesse O. Norton, Esq. U.S. Attorney.<br></br>
      Chicago. Ill.<br></br>
      Sir:
      
      
      
      <p>I enclose herewith a letter addressed to me by  <sup><a href="#fn2" id="WCarter">2</a></sup>Mr. W.A. Carter of Utah Terr. in which I am informed that a murder was committed recently in Dakota Terr. of a merchant or peddler named <sup><a href="#fn3" id="Bicking">3</a></sup>Bicking, whose home was in Denver, Colorado Terr., (where his widow resides still,) by two men named <sup><a href="#fn4" id="MStickney">4</a></sup>Stickney and <sup><a href="#fn5" id="GBlack">3</a></sup>Black, (persons formerly belonging in Rochford and Chicago, respectively, in Illinois, where they are said to have opulent &amp; influential relatives.)&#x2014;the latter
         of whom has made full confession;&#x2014;and that both are now in jail at Chicago, Ill., awaiting an examination, which is set for the 8th prose.,; And the proper requisition of the Executive authority of the Territory in which the
         murder was committed, &amp; the proper warrant of extradition for trial in the courts
         of said Territory. The first Sec. of the Act of Congress of 12th Feb. 1793, (12 Stats [States]
         , 302,) seems to afford the Executive authority of the Territory in which the murder
         was committed, all the advice he could need for his action, upon one confirm:ation [confirmation]
          of the fact, But as so early a day has been fixed for the hearing, there is little
         probability that the proper requisition will be forthcoming in so short a time&#x2014; &amp;
         it is possible that
         A failure of justice might result from the absence of parties or counsel interested
         in favor of the prosecution. 
         </p>
      
      <p>Under these peculiar circumstances, you are hereby directed to act for the United States, &amp; the Territory of Dakota, in the matter upon such Data as may be accessible to you, &amp; procure such a commitment
         as shall subverse the ends of justice.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         A copy of this letter is furnished to Mr. Carter, from whom you may expect further
         information &amp; Testimony.
         </p>
      
      Respectfully, &amp; Yours,<br></br>
